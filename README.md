# ML-portfolio
Here will be some of my ML projects. Enjoy it!

Hi. 
Here yo can find some of my projects, which I prepare for portfolio. I hope, you enjoy it.
I’ll describe that can find in my folders.

1. Working with BD – here will be 2 files. In one I create my data base, in second I make different queries from simple to 
advanced ( I hope it’s advanced level of queries).

2. Parser – here you can find 4 files in which I get information from web-site olx.ua. I want to get information about 
renting apartment in Odessa
    Part 1 – I parse catalog and all pages about renting the apartment.
    Part 2 – I choose manual one link with apartment and parse to get information which is interesting for me.
    Part 3 – To get the phone number I need to click on the button and only after making such manipulation I will get 
    the phone number. So I use package Selenium which help me to solve this problem.
    Part 4 – I parse Google Api for getting latitude and longitude and distance between 2 locations.

3. Recommender System – here will be only 2 folders.
    Simple recommender system.
    Movies Dataset – 1 Project. Here is 2 files: EDA – Exploratory Data Analysis, where I use different visualization tools 
    to understand what type of data did I have. And Recommendation Engine – where I use such algorithms Content Based Recommender, 
    Based Recommender, Hybrid recommender to make my recommendation system.

4. Dashboards – here I use Plotly and Dash packages for visualization.
    Project 1 – here I use Plotly to make some 3 dashboards.
    Project 2 – here I combine Plotly and Dash packages mo make dashboards with buttons, calendar, 
    drop-boxes and so on. (run the code in text editors such as Sublime Text, Atom or from Terminal or Command Prompt. 
    After type in any browser  http://127.0.0.1:8050/  and you will see the result).

5. Titanic – Survival Prediction. I use classification algorithms to determine the survival rate.
    Importing, Cleaning, EDA – in this file I inspect my data and create a new feature.
    ML processing/ML Processing/ML3 – in first two files I use different classification algorithms. In ML 3 I combine 
    all tests from part 1 and 2 and added some missing aspects which I didn’t use before.

6. House Prediction – Regression. Here I predict the cost of house.
    Main EDA – in this file I inspect my data and create a new feature.
    Project 1/1.5/2/2.5 and Project 3 – I use different regression algorithms to find the best model. Start from simple 
    models and finish with ensemble methods: averaging, boosting, voting, stacking models.
